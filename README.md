SchoolProject

## Instruction 

1) To pull project onto your folder
- Install Git if you haven't.
2) Open Command Prompt and "cd" into your workspace directory ( Where you want unity project to exist)
3) Run the following commands:
- git clone https://github.com/Laos0/IdleGame.git
- You should now have the full project
4) Use Unity to open the project
5) Send me your gitHub user names so I add you to gitHub project, only then you can commit and push to my repo.
6) Once I(Sony) have added you, I will let you know and you need to go to your gitHub and accept my invitation.
7) On your top right corner of gitHub, there is a bell that will be a alerted icon, click on it and accept my invitation and you should be good to go.


## IMPORTANT NOTES

1) Only one person should work on a scene at any given time.  Only after they committed and pushed the scene then can another person do a pull and make changes to the target scene.
2) Multiple changes on the same scene by two different users can cause a conflict merge, which is hard to resolve.
3) Always pull before you push anything and if their are conflicts then resolve it.
4) Inform everyone what classes and/or scene you are working on to avoid merge conflicts with Git.
5) Before you start coding, always do a git pull

## Example of what can happen
1) User A and B checks out the master and pulls the master branch to their local machine/laptop etc.
2) User A makes a change inside classA and commits and pushs
3) User B makes a change inside classA and commits and pushs
4) Git will not let user B to push, user B can commit but cannot push
5) User B will have to do a git pull, resolve any conflicts, commit again and then push again.
